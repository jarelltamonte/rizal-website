              A National Hero educated across three continents, Rizal
              synthesized Western medicine, European philosophy, and Asian
              perspectives. His formal training in ophthalmology, combined with
              self-study in ethnology and linguistics, created the unique
              intellectual framework for his reformist writings and
              nation-building vision.

            They knew him as a lover, a poet, a dreamerâ€”but never fully. Each
            woman glimpsed a piece of his heart, yet he remained a riddle
            wrapped in exile and revolution. To love Jose Rizal was to chase a
            ghost already claimed by destiny.
